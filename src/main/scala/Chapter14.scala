  /**
   * Task 1:
   *
   * Your Java Development Kit distribution has the source code for much of the JDK in the
   * `src.zip` file. Unzip and search for case labels (regular expression `case [^:]+:`).
   * Then look for comments starting with `//` and containing `[Ff]alls? thr` to catch comments
   * such as `// Falls through` or `// just fall thru`.
   * Assuming the JDK programmers follow the Java code convention, which requires such a comment,
   * what percentage of cases falls through?
   *
   * Solution:
   * {{{
   *  mkdir /tmp/java-test/src
   *  unzip /usr/lib/jvm/java-7-oracle/src.zip -d /tmp/java-test/src
   *  cd /tmp/java-test
   *  grep --include=*.java -r -E 'case [^:]+:' src > 1.txt
   *  grep --include=*.java -r -E '//.*[Ff]alls? thr' src > 2.txt
   * }}}
   * As a result on my machine there is around 9500 lines in the first file and
   * 100 lines in the second file. Then:
   * {{{
   *  (100 * 100%) / 9500 = 1%
   * }}}

  /**
   * Task 2:
   *
   * Using pattern matching, write a function `swap` that receives a pair of integers and
   * returns the pair with the components swapped.
